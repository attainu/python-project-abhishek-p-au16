# Junk File Organizer with Python
Basically, as a lazy programmer my desktop is full of files (Junk Files). Due to the large number of files, it is a daunting task to sit and organize each file. To make that task easy the below Python script comes handy and all the files are organized in a well-manner within seconds.

## Main functionality of this code

 #### 1. Organize by extension
by using this option user can organize their files by their file extension in a given folder, folder will be created according to file extension and finally all files will be moved to a created folder.
 #### 2. Organize by size
 by using this option user can organisze their files by their file size in a given folder,folder will be created according to filesize and finally all files will be moved to a created folder.
#### what i used :
python-3.9.1

I used many built-in libraries like- shutil and os
### future improvement:
We can design the ui for the program so a normal user can easily interact with it.


We can add more features like deleting the junk files after a certain period of time.
