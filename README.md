# Junk File Organizer with Python
Basically, as a lazy programmer my desktop is full of files (Junk Files). Due to the large number of files, it is a daunting task to sit and organize each file. To make that task easy the below Python script comes handy and all the files are organized in a well-manner within seconds.

## Main functionality of this code
 *  Organize by extension
 #### 1. Organize by extension
by using this option user can organize their files by their file extension in a given folder, folder will be created according to file extension and finally all files will be moved to a created folder.
#### what i used :
I used many built-in libraries like- shutil for file movement
### future improvement:
We can design the ui for the program so a normal user can easily interact with it.
We can add more features like deleting the junk files after a certain period of time.
